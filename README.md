# Tiny Blog

Welcome to Tiny Blog, a simple and elegant blogging application built with React, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript. This application uses the [Dummy JSON API](https://dummyjson.com/) to retrieve a list of users, articles, and comments, and allows users to view and add comments when logged in.

## Features
- User authentication with Auth0
- List of articles and comments
- Dropdown button to show and hide articles
